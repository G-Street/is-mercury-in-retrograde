  Is Mercury in retrograde?

### Ephemeris

> *(plural: ephemerides)*: A table or data file giving the calculated positions of a celestial object at regular intervals throughout a period.

### What am I reading?

This is a description for the back-end of a website which tells you whether or not Mercury is in retrograde.  This project is dedicated to Olivia.  This project has been developed by [jakewilliami](https://github.com/jakewilliami) and [andfield](https://github.com/andfield).

### How to set up this project

Our dependency for [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is that you have Python 3.3+.  You need to check this is installed:
```
python[3] --version
```
Now download your virtual environment toolbox:
```
pip[3] install virtualenv
```
`cd` to your project directory and run
```
python[3] -m venv <project-name>
virtualenv <project-name>
source <project-name>/bin/activate
```
Now we need to set up flask and get our dependencies.  Run
```
pip[3] install -r requirements.txt
```
And you are set up.  Run `python[3] app.py` to get the local server running.  Non-local server is currently in progress.  You can run `deactivate` to escape your virtual environment.


### What is retrograde motion?
All objects in the sky move East to West during a night due to the West to East rotation of the Earth.  Retrograde motion is when a planet moves East to West relative to the stars.

Looking down on the solar system from the North, prograde motion occurs when the line from the Earth to the object rotates counterclockwise (in the same way the planets actually move). Retrograde motion occurs when the line rotates clockwise because the Earth passes the planet.  Hence, retrograde motion only occurs if the Earth is moving faster than Mercury.  Mercury will appears to move backwards when we pass it.  This is possible because of Keplerâ€™s second law of planetary motion, which states that planets can move at different speeds during their orbit depending on their proximity to the Sun.  The concept of variable orbital speed comes up again in Kepler's third law.  This latter law states that the time it takes for a planet to orbit the Sun depends on the size of it's orbit, according to the rule
```
P^2 = a^3
```
with `P` in years, and `a` in astronomical units (AU).

The primary ephemeris we collect with regard to Mercury is it's *Right Ascension* (RA).  [According to the American Institute of Physics](https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/history/teaching-guides/follow-drinking-gourd/Follow%20the%20Drinking%20Gourd_RA%20Dec%20Handout.pdf), Right Ascension is the astronomical equivalent of longitude.  More specifically, it is the angular distance of an object measured eastward from the *Vernal Equinox*.  For a more detailed description of this, see pp. 17-19, 35-37, 72-74, 179-180, 199 of Montenbruck & Pfleger 2000 book, *Astronomy on the Personal Computer* (Fourth, Completely Revised Edition).  For more basic information on how ephemerides are calculated, go to [the NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/transit_algorithms.html).

Most importantly: *when Mercury's RA is decreasing over time, it is in retrograde*.

### Calculation and Generation of Ephemerides

Within one's personal computer, one can access wonders.

We have found four very excellent and open-source repositories that have helped us to determine this critical question:

1. [A Python library developed by Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-jplephem).  This library provides mathematical tools (used by the *Jet Propulsion Laboratory* to calculate their ephemerides) to predict raw planetary positions in three-dimensional space.
2. [A Python library developed by skyfielders](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield).  This library sources data from the *United States Naval Observatory and the International Earth Rotation Service*, and used the above repository in its calculations.
3. [A python library also developed by Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem).  This library is specifically focussed on the Scientific calculations for Atronomy.
4. [A Julia library](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/JPLEphemeris.jl) provided by [JuliaAstro](https://juliaastro.github.io/).  This is based on the former-mentioned repository, and provides a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) implementation of these mathematical and astronomical tools.

With the help of these excellent resources, we have managed to calculate whether or not Mercury is in retrograde.

### Setting Up Julia Alternative

Ensure you have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) downloaded and installed.  We have created a virtual environment in `alt/astro-alt.jl/`.  To use this on your machine, run
```
$ cd is-mercury-in-retrograde/alt/astro-alt.jl/
$ julia
julia> ]
pkg> activate .
(astro-alt.jl) instantiate
```
To run the project, you will need to specify the project directory:
```
$ cd is-mercury-in-retrograde/alt/astro-alt.jl/
$ julia --project=. astro-alt.jl
```
See the [manual](is-mercury-in-retrograde/alt/astro-alt.jl/) for more information on this.

Finally, you need to download the data file:
```
$ cd is-mercury-in-retrograde/alt/astro-alt.jl/
$ wget https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de430.bsp # for the JPLEphemeris package
$ wget ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/inpop13c/inpop13c_TDB_m100_p100_tt.dat # for the CALCEPH package
```

### Room for improvement

There is room for improvement.  Within the script `astro.py` and `astro-alt.py`, we have defined two points in time by defining one, waiting, and defining another.  This is undoubtably not the best way to do this, but this was the only way I found that works.  In the early drafts of the script, we would define a time `t1` which is five seconds before the current time, but this did not work for some reason.  We would always be open for any help on this.
